# Learn Numpy

This repository includes exercises I collect to learn and practice Numpy.

Below are some important links related to Numpy
- [Numpy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) (NumPy v1.21)
- [Numpy Quickstart](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) (Fundamentals of Numpy)
- [Numpy for beginner](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) (Introduction and important Numpy basics, e.g., installing, importing, Numpy array)
- [Numpy axes explained](https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/numpy-axes-explained/#:~:text=NumPy%20axes%20are%20the%20directions,along%20the%20rows%20and%20columns.) (I find that this article explains the concept "axis" in Numpy very clearly. Highly recommended for those who are new and want to get a firm understanding about axes in Numpy arrays)
- [Numpy slicing and indexing](https://towardsdatascience.com/slicing-numpy-arrays-like-a-ninja-e4910670ceb0)

Happy Learning. Cheers!
